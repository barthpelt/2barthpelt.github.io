                        My main interest for IT is the vastness of the possibilities offered by new technologies. Today we are able to develop websites, applications quite easily. 
                        New technologies allow us to do such incredible things ! What interests me the most is the front-end development is that it allows us to create beautiful user interfaces. 
                        Nowadays, thanks to javascript, we can develop the front and back part of a website, for example thanks to the react frameworks for the front and node.js for the back. 
                        My goal is to be able to manage with these two frameworks in order to be as autonomous as possible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My interest for IT started when I was a kid. My father shared with me his passion for new technologies. 
                        I was lucky to have my first computer when I was 8 years old. 
                        He showed me not only how the operating system (Mac OS 9) worked but also the file system, folders, how to use a web browser and do word processing. 
                        I am curious so I started doing some research to better understand how it works. 
                        Then all the knowledge I have acquired is the result of many hours of research.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The experiences I have in IT are about front-end web development. 
                        As a part of my studies I have the chance to work with companies during concrete projects. 
                        In addition, I did a two-month internship in which I had to redesign a web platform for software licensing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I chose to come to study at RMIT because it was the only university that offered IT and web development courses. 
                        I also knew its very good reputation worldwide. During my semester at RMIT, I hope I will make progress in English, and especially gain skills in the subjects I study in my curriculum in France.
